# Patrician 3 Insights
This book is a compilation of insights gained by reverse engineering of Ascaron's game *Patrician 3*.
It is **not** a guide that explains strategies and tactics, the only purpose is to explain the game's behavior as accurately as possible.

All names (of functions, structs, enums, classes, static objects) have been guessed during the reverse engineering process.
The original names are unknown.

The book is [open source](https://github.com/P3Modding/p3modding.github.io). If you spot something wrong or want to contribute, send a pull request or open an issue.
