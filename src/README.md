# Patrician 3 Insights

This book is a compilation of insights gained by reverse engineering of Ascaron's game *Patrician 3*.
It is **not** a guide that explains strategies and tactics, the only purpose is to explain the game's behavior as accurately as possible.

The book is [open source](https://github.com/P3Modding/p3modding.github.io). If you spot something wrong or want to contribute, send a pull request or open an issue.
