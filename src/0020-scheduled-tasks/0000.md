# Scheduled Tasks
P3 has a task queue for actions that shall be executed at a given tick in the future.

## Scheduled Tasks Struct
```
00000000 struct scheduled_tasks // sizeof=0x14
00000000 {
00000000     scheduled_task *field_0_tasks;
00000004     int field_4_is_in_use;
00000008     unsigned __int16 field_8_earliest_scheduled_task_index;
0000000A     __int16 field_A;
0000000C     unsigned __int16 field_C_tasks_size;
0000000E     __int16 field_E;
00000010     int field_10;
00000014 };
```
The static scheduled tasks object is at `0x006DD73C`.
The `handle_scheduled_tasks_tick` function at `0x004D85C0` executes all tasks that are due.
It is called at least once per tick.

## Scheduled Task Struct
```
00000000 struct scheduled_task // sizeof=0x18
00000000 {
00000000     unsigned int field_0_due_timestamp;
00000004     unsigned __int16 field_4_next_task_index;
00000006     scheduled_task_opcode field_6_opcode;
00000008     scheduled_task_union field_8_data;
00000018 };
```
The scheduled task's opcdode field denotes which kind of task it is.
Some task types are recurring, and reschedule themselves immediately when they are executed.
The data field is a union containing all possible task arguments.
