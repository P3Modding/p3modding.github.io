# Buildings
New building ids, used in operations that create new buildings, are represented by the following enum:
```rust
pub enum NewBuildingId {
    Well = 0x28,
    Tower = 0x29, // Cannon, Bombard; Gate, Port
    HousePoor = 0x2a,
    PitchShoot = 0x2f,
    HouseWealthy = 0x50,
    HouseRich = 0x51,
    FarmGrain = 0x53,
    FarmHemp = 0x54,
    FarmSheep = 0x55,
    FarmCattle = 0x56,
    FishermansHouse = 0x57,
    Brewery = 0x58,
    Apiary = 0x59,
    WeavingMill = 0x5a,
    Workshop = 0x5b,
    Vineyard = 0x5c,
    HuntingLodge = 0x5d,
    Saltworks = 0x5e,
    IronSmelter = 0x60,
    Pitchmaker = 0x61,
    Brickworks = 0x62,
    Pottery = 0x63,
    Sawmill = 0x64,

    Warehouse = 0x66,
    Mint = 0x67,

    Chapel = 0x69,
}
```
